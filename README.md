# Pixel font

5x5 Pixel font for Flipdot displays
![example](images/big.png)

and a 3x3 Pixel font for very small displays
![example](images/small.png)

## Usage
These fonts are made in JavaScript and every character is represented as an array of 0s and 1s.
Example:
```js
const characters = {
      "A": [
        [0,1,1,1,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1],
        [1,1,1,1,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1],
        [1,0,0,0,1],
    ],
    etc...
```
Big letters are located in `js/font.js` and small letters in `js/font-small.js`.

### Special characters (5x5)
To place special characters which save space, you can use these single-character representations:
- Question + Exclamation in one character: "~"
- 'IJ' in one character: "^"

## Testing and Demo
You can test and demo the fonts in your browser by opening `index.html`. This allows you to test out characters in the two different fonts and with a few animations.
Clone the repo and open a live server to test it out.
